Q2. Explain the role of the following key properties in the Flexbox layout modes
1. justify-content
2. align-items
3. gap
4. flex-direction
5. flex-wrap

Ans:
1. justify-content: This property aligns the flex items along the main axis (horizontally by default). It defines the distribution of space between and around content items.

Examples: flex-start, flex-end, center, space-between, space-around, space-evenly.

2. align-items: This property aligns the flex items along the cross axis (vertically by default). It determines how the items are laid out within a container.

Examples: stretch, flex-start, flex-end, center, baseline.

3. gap: This property defines the spacing between flex items. It's like setting margin around every flex item.

Examples: gap: 10px;, gap: 1rem;.

4. flex-direction: This property defines the direction of the main axis. It controls the direction in which the flex items are placed in the flex container.

Examples: row, row-reverse, column, column-reverse.

5. flex-wrap: This property controls whether the flex container is single-line or multi-line, and the direction the new lines are stacked.

Examples: nowrap, wrap, wrap-reverse.
