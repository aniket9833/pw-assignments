1. Semantic HTML Elements: Use semantic HTML elements to provide meaningful structure and information. Semantic elements like `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<article>`, `<section>`, and `<footer>` help screen readers and other assistive technologies understand the content and its hierarchy.

2. Text Alternatives for Images: Provide descriptive and meaningful alt text for images using the `alt` attribute. This is essential for users who rely on screen readers or may have images disabled. Alt text should convey the purpose or content of the image.

3. Keyboard Accessibility: Ensure that all interactive elements on your website can be accessed and operated using a keyboard. This is crucial for users who may have motor impairments and rely on keyboard navigation. Test your website's functionality without a mouse to ensure a seamless keyboard experience.
