HTML entities are special codes used to represent characters that have special meaning in HTML, such as reserved characters (<, >, &, etc.), characters with special formatting or display requirements, and characters that cannot be easily typed on a keyboard.

Here are five commonly used HTML entities:

1. &lt;: Represents the less-than sign ("<").
2. &gt;: Represents the greater-than sign (">").
3. &amp;: Represents the ampersand ("&").
4. &quot;: Represents the double quotation mark (").
5. &nbsp;: Represents a non-breaking space, which prevents the browser from collapsing consecutive spaces into a single space.
