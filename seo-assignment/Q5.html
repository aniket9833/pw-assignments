<!-- A favicon, short for "favorite icon," is a small, typically square image or icon associated with a website. Favicons are displayed in the browser's address bar, tabs, bookmarks, and other areas, providing a visual representation of the website. They are also known as website icons, tab icons, or bookmark icons.

The main purposes of favicons are:

Brand Recognition: Favicons often feature a simplified version of a website's logo or a distinctive symbol related to the brand. This helps users quickly identify and recognize the site when multiple tabs or bookmarks are open in a browser.

Enhanced User Experience: Favicons contribute to the overall user experience by adding a visual element to the browser interface. Users can easily locate and distinguish between different websites based on their unique icons. -->
